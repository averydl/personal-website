      Hi, I'm Derek! I spent a year and a half working as a Civil Engineer
      at a consulting firm in Seattle, WA, but quickly realized that I am more
      engaged by the challenges posed by software development. I recently enrolled
      to study computer science full time at Bellevue College, and I am
      currently seeking an internship for Summer 2019.
      <br><br>
      I would love nothing more than to get engaged with projects that I know will
      have a meaningful impact, rather than simply being assigned 'basic' intern-oriented
      tasks. While I am new to the tech world, I have had my fair share of experiences
      'under fire' in the fast-paced consulting world while working as a Civil Engineer.
      That said, I'm no stranger to hard work, and I'm very passionate about continued
      learning both at work and in my own personal time!
      <br><br>
      When I'm not practicing coding you can find me outside running, taking on new
      hikes, or traveling to Mexico and practicing mi Español!
